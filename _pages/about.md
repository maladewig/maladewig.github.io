I recently obtained my PhD in Economics at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU). In my research, I am interested in questions at the intersection of forest conservation and livelihoods to understand better how the progressing issue of deforestation can be tackled without compromising forest-dependent communities.

My doctoral thesis entitled "Mining, livelihoods and forest conservation in the DR Congo" was focused on the implications of mineral extraction in the Democratic Republic of Congo for both local communities and forest ecosystems. The thesis relied on the use of spatially-explicit econometric models of impact evaluation, primary data from household surveys and geospatial data from satellite images. It can be [downloaded here](https://main-bvxea6i-kdsvgmpf4iwws.eu-5.platformsh.site/sites/default/files/2025-03/Malte%20Ladewig_Thesis.pdf).
